A modern InmoApp application built with Next.js, implementing tenant isolation and management features.

## Features

- InmoApp architecture with tenant isolation
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript support
- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- Tenant-specific routing and data management

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
